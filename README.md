## Why this project was chosen (what use case does it solve) ?
It helps to understand the core basics of functional components and working of Hooks in functional component.


##	How did you make the project (Tech Stack, Database, APIs) ?
- I made this project using  React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.

##	What features, technical things you had implemented ?
  The main technical features in my project:
- App is made using fuctional component of react. 
- The Proper use of useState Hook.
